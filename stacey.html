               <p>The graph titled "Trends of Deaths in Canada (2000-2017)" displays the number of deaths across various causes over time, categorized by years, with color-coded bars making it easy to compare trends. It highlights persistent and emerging health issues, offering valuable insights for policymakers, researchers, and healthcare professionals. Major causes of death, such as Ischemic heart diseases, Diabetes, and Cancers, consistently show high death counts across the years, reflecting their ongoing health burden. Infectious diseases like Tuberculosis and Malaria contribute far less to overall mortality compared to chronic illnesses. Additionally, causes like Influenza and Pneumonia appear stable over time, though they remain significant contributors to mortality. This visualization helps identify priorities for resource allocation, public health interventions, and further studies into emerging and persistent health risks.

               <p>The graph titled "Number of Deaths by Cause in Canada (2000–2017)" visualizes mortality across various causes of death, with a focus on the year each year. The vertical bars represent the number of deaths for each cause, with a color-coded distinction highlighting specific categories like Complications of medical and surgical care and Atherosclerosis. This visualization is useful for understanding which health conditions contributed most to mortality in Canada, while also providing insights into trends over time. From the graph, it is clear that Atherosclerosis stands out with a notably high number of deaths in 2017 while in 2000 the most notbal high number of deaths were due to acute poliomyelitis and arthorpod-born virlaencephalitis.

               <p>The pie chart titled "Leading causes of death (ICD-10) 17 18 19" highlights the top contributors to mortality from 2000 to 2017. Congenital malformations, deformations, and chromosomal abnormalities are the leading cause, accounting for 15.4% of deaths, emphasizing the significant impact of genetic and developmental disorders. Certain conditions originating in the perinatal period follow closely at 15%, underscoring the critical health risks faced during early infancy. Additionally, pneumonitis due to solids and liquids contributes 11.9%, reflecting the role of respiratory complications in mortality rates. These three causes collectively highlight the importance of addressing congenital, early-life, and respiratory health challenges to reduce overall mortality.
